    <p>The Examination Information System (EIS) is unique and innovative software which addresses all examinations related activities. This system support all examination related activities such as checking of result, to view registered courses, to check student attendance status, to check exam time table and checking student profile.
        This system also makes environmental friendly institution by considerably reducing or eliminating use of paper.
    
    INTRODUCTION
    The Examination Information Systems (EIS) covers material that is usually taught in an introductory college-level business information systems course. Questions test knowledge, terminology, and basic concepts about information systems as well as the application of that knowledge. The EIS does not emphasize the details of hardware design and language-specific programming techniques. References to applications such as word processing or spreadsheets do not require knowledge of a specific product. The focus is on concepts and techniques applicable to a variety of products and environments. Knowledge of arithmetic and mathematics equivalent to that of a student who has successfully completed a traditional first-year high school algebra course is assumed.
    Examination Information Systems textbooks differ on the precise definition of the systems development process or life cycle. To avoid ambiguity, the systems development process as  the following discrete phases or stages:

     <P>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
        The project is targeted for only 100level Exam Information System taking Kwara State University, college of Information and Communication Technology, department of computer science as a case of study.
        
        
        METHODOLOGY
        The method use in this project is based on Observation and Research. 
        Observation: Offers the Social Research a distinct way of collecting data. It does not rely on what people say they do, or what they say they think. It is more direct than that, instead, it draws on the direct evidence of the eye to witness event first hand. It is based on the premise that, for certain purpose, it is the best to observe what actually happen.  
         Research Method is adopted to gather information. This process of getting information via any search engines like Google, wikipedia e.t.c.
        
        
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
                   Analysis is all about finding facts about a system with a view to understand and easing the various operations performed by a system appreciably.
            This chapter deals with the system analysis and findings, which gives the details analysis of the system. In this system there is a lot of design interface or modules which include the following:
        •	Admin Module: In this module, the administrator can set exam time table, post result and also administrator can provide login credentials to the user.
        •	Student Module: In this student module, the student will be able to see each semester result, check time table, check his/her profile, registered courses and also able to view his or her percentage of attendance in class.
        •	Registered Course Module: In this module, the students can view his/her  semester courses.

    <P> DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
        By ways of comparism as earlier stated, proposed system provides solution to the above problem to the above problems.
        In the proposed system, there are advantages which is stated below
        •	It is fast.
        •	It is very accurate that is, error free.
        •	It can only access by authorized user.
        •	It reduces stress.
        
        
        
        SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
        An Examination Information System can be implemented, using login which requires username and password which the username will be student matric number and password will be student surname. It is a desktop application, which does not need support of browser to perform the running.
         Valid students will have their student matric number and other details that verify a user as a student. Therefore, the password will ensure that only legitimate student can be authorized to access the system.
        
        RESULT
        After the login, a simple and user friendly interface in used,  which will help even if a student does not know how to use the system. 
        The focus in more on the visual representation of data, and no unnecessary links are used, the interface is made as simple as possible with only basic functionalities.
        
        DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM 
        The programming language used in this project is Visual Basic 6.0. 
        
        SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
        •	SYSTEM REQUIREMENT 
        The system requirement include the following
        	AVAILABILITY OF MEMORY SPACE: The memory space must be checked periodically to detect if the available memory has been used up and provision should be made for memory expansion.
        	PERIODIC BACKUP: All the system, especially the server must have it own UPS (Uninterrupted Powy ) and stabilizer to prevent power surge and data loss.
        	APPROPRIATE VENTILATION: The system should be kept in a cool, air filled environment since all electronics equipment generates it, there must be a provision for cooling the heat generated to prevent burning. There must be a fan or air conditioning equipment at all times to provide ventilation.
